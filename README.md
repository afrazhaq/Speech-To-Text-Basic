# Speech-To-Text-Basic
## Description ##
Speech-To-Text 1.0 or STT 1.0, which simply takes raw input from microphone for x seconds and then displays the recognised text. I created this simple Python program while studying the basics. It uses two libraries, the former uses Google Cloud Speech API for speech recognition while the latter is used for recording audio.


## Libraries ##
1. [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)

2. [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)
